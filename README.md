This repo contains C# bindings for [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/) as well as a [Biohazrd](https://github.com/MochiLibraries/Biohazrd)-powered generator for generating them.

In contrast to other C# bindings for Dear ImGui, this one interacts with the C++ API directly and is lower-level. If you need high-level bindings consider using the excellent [ImGui.NET](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET) instead.
